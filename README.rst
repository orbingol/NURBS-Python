Introduction
============

NURBS-Python (geomdl) is an object-oriented B-Spline and NURBS surface and curve library for Python with
implementations of advanced computation algorithms in an extensible way.
It comes with on-the-fly shape visualization options, knot vector and surface grid generators, and more.

NURBS-Python is a pure Python library, therefore there are no external C/C++ or FORTRAN dependencies or any compilation
steps during installation. It is tested with Python v2.7.x, Python v3.3.x and later versions. The Python 2 and 3
compatibility library ``six`` will be automatically installed during NURBS-Python setup.

Branch Information
------------------

* ``master`` branch contains code for NURBS-Python (geomdl) v4.x series
* ``3.x`` branch contains code for NURBS-Python v3.x series
* ``2.x`` branch contains code for NURBS-Python v2.x series
