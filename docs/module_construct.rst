Geometry Constructors and Extractors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``construct`` module provides functions for constructing and extracting parametric shapes. A surface can be constructed
from curves and a volume can be constructed from surfaces. Moreover, a surface can be extracted to curves and a volume
can be extracted to surfaces in all parametric directions.
