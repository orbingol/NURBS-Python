Evaluators
^^^^^^^^^^

Evaluators (or evaluation strategies) allow users to change curve and/or surface evaluation strategy,
i.e. the algorithms that are used to evaluate the curve & surface, take derivatives and more.
Therefore, the user can switch between the evaluation algorithms at runtime, implement and use different algorithms
or improve existing ones.
