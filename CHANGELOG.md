## v3.7.8 released on 2018-06-04

* Minor updates

## v3.7.7 released on 2018-05-06

* Bug fix release

## v3.7.1 released on 2018-04-19

* Removed unnecessary evaluations while setting `sample_size` and `delta` properties.

## v3.7.0 released on 2018-04-19

* Added `delta_u` and `delta_v` properties to Surface classes. This change allows different sampling in u- and v-directions
* Fixed some bugs related to `sample_size` property
* Replaced `delta` with `sample_size` in Multi classes. `sample_size` property directly corresponds to `num` argument in [numpy.linspace](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) function.

These changes may cause a small API break in your existing code, especially if you are visualizing using the `geomdl.visualization.VisMPL` component.
Please see the examples repository and check any example for the updated usage scenarios.

## v3.6.7 released on 2018-04-07

* Added `sample_size` property.

`sample_size` works very similar to `numpy.linspace`. In `numpy.linspace`, you define start and end positions with the number or samples to generate between them.
This property automatically sets the `delta` property, so after setting `sample_size`, there is no need to play with `delta`.

* `Multi` module is designed to operate on multiple curves and surfaces. Currently, it can only do multi curve and multi surface visualization (in 2D and 3D) on the same window. Documentation will come soon.
* `Abstract` module provides a base for further development of the NURBS algorithms. It will become the base class for B-Spline and NURBS curves and surfaces represented in NURBS-Python. Unfortunately, the module is still WIP and it could remain like that for a while.

* Initial stable release of NURBS-Python v3.0.0
* Added the library to Python Package Index (PyPI).

## v3.0b3 released on 2018-01-09

* Bug fixes
* Update visualization component

## v3.0b2 released on 2018-01-08

* Added visualization module.

Visualization module is an optional module for NURBS-Python. In other words, you don't need to import it to evaluate surfaces and curves.

The visualization module currently includes a base class `VisABC` which can be used to create new visualization components, and `VisMPL` component that implements [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for 2D and 3D plotting.

Please see the following  for usage examples:

* [ex_curve01.py](https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python_Examples/blob/master/curve2d/ex_curve01.py) - 2D Curve
* [ex_curve3d01.py](https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python_Examples/blob/master/curve3d/ex_curve3d01.py) - 3D curve
* Surface visualization component is also complete but currently there are no examples. Please check the [examples repository](https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python_Examples) for more details.

## v3.0b1 released on 2018-01-07

This is the first beta release of NURBS-Python after a huge set of new features and updates. Unfortunately, there has been some API changes between _v2.x_ and _v3.x_ series but these changes are not too big, so you might only need to change the import statements to make things working again.

The _v2.x_ code is moved to `2.x` branch. This version will not receive any updates, since I would like to focus on _v3.x_ branch from now on.

* Please check the README file and the [documentation](http://nurbs-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for changes in the implementation. I updated the class structure and now the code has different classes for 2D and 3D curves. I also added different classes for B-Spline (NUBS) and NURBS implementations of curves and surfaces.
* There are more file reading and writing routines, such as different types of TXT formats and CSV export for using the data for various visualization software.
* Of course, new version fixes some of the bugs and reorganizes the code
* The documentation is reorganized and vastly improved: http://nurbs-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ -- You can still access _v2.x_ series documentation [here](http://nurbs-python.readthedocs.io/en/2.x/).
* __New functionality:__ Knot insertion in curves and surfaces
* JSON support (will be extended/merged from the existing branch)
* An optional visualization module using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Visualization module can be extended to use other visualization tools.
* New CSV and TXT export modes
* Documentation improvements and more examples

The examples repository is also updated with some nice visualization examples using Matplotlib and demonstrating new TXT and CSV export features.
